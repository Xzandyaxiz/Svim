# Svim
Svim (Super vim) is a terminal based text editor similar to vim.

Currently only supports systems based on gnu/linux.

## Installation
Clone the git repository and copy it to your `/usr/local/bin` directory

```bash
sudo cp Svim/svim /usr/local/bin/
```
And then make it executable
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/svim
```

## How to use
To open a file with Svim, simply pass it with an argument as the file you want to open.
```bash
svim YOUR_FILE
```

Shortcuts are:
* ctrl+s for writing changes
* q for exiting
